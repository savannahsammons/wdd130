                    I learned piano from my mom who has taught beginner piano out of our house since I was little. I am so grateful
                    for her example and for teaching my sisters and I because music is a big part of who I am today. I finished the course my mom taught
                    and that I plan on teaching as well, and learned from there. My continuing development comes from playing in ward sacrament and playing for the ward choir.<br>
                    <h1 class="title">My Purpose:</h1>
                    My goal is to give individuals, parents and children an opportunity to learn beginner music thoery and how to read simple sheet music
                    at a low cost. This way, if you or your child find out that they are not interested in learning piano, not much has been spent in providing lessons, and your
                    child can decide to no longer take lessons at any time. If you or your child decide to continue learning piano, you have a basic understanding of reading sheet music and 
                    can either continue to teach yourself from then on like I did, or take more advanced lessons from a professional and already have the discipline and understanding to keep going. 
                    By learning piano, you learn many different life skills at a young age including patience, dedication, persistance, math skills, reading skills, and develop many 
                    other learning advantages that benefit you for the rest of your life.
